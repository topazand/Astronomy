	- Redshift value z=1.914
	- First observed by HST, as part of the CANDELS+CLASH Supernova Project
	- Also known as SN Wilson
	- Type Ia SPN is defined by a lack of hydrogen and helium lines and presence of strong SiII lines
	- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0768.pdf(in folder)

	- GOODS is intended to enable astronomers to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in the distant, early universe
	- https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08522(in folder)
PSS 0133+0400 & PSS 0955+5940(also quasar)
	- Provides evidence that dark energy may vary over time
	- Data from CHandra and XMM-Newton to measure the correlation between UV and X-ray energies that measures the luminosity
	- QUasar->standard candles

- AGN
3C 273
	- Optically brightest and first identified quasar, at constellation virgo
	- z=0.158, 2.4Gly
	- *has visible jet*(take a look at the images)
	- 273th object, ordered by RA, or the 3C catalog
	- Was a radio source associated with an optical counterpart
	- Radio-loud quasar

NGC 2623
	- Interacting galaxy(two merging spiral galaxies); has active galactic nucleii, and therefore classified as seyfert
	- The merger provide us with a better idea of the coming collision between milky way and andromeda
	- compression of gas-> large amount of star formation
	- Large tidal tails is a strong indicator of the merging of multiple galaxies.
M87
	- a supergiant elliptical galaxy with AGN
	- SMBH is imaged by the event horizon telescope (EHT)
	- Relativistic jet showing superluminal motion
	- Infrared, radio, and X-ray image of the jet(wikipedia)
	- Excess emission at wavelength >25um caused by the synchrotron radiation from the jet
H2356-309
	- A blazer located behind the sculptor wall, detected by Chandra and XMM-Newton
	- Scientist observe absorption of it slight in the WHIM
	- The dip in X-rays towards the right side of the spectrum corresponds to absorption by oxygen atoms in the WHIM contained in the Sculptor Wall.
H1821+643
	- Quasar at constellation of Draco, most massive black hole at 30 billion solar mass
	- WHIM on the filaments along the LOS absorbs X-rays emitted by the quasar(stacked many observations due to the weak absorption)
	- WHIM is invisible to optical light telescope
	- Quasar at the center of a cooling-core galaxy cluster 
	- Center is cooler than edges because it is denser and emits more energy	
- Galaxy & Clusters
DLA0817g
	- Wolfe Disk, at constellation cancer, discovered by ALMA and VLA(radio)
	- disc galaxy dating back to 1.5 mllon years after the big bang
	- challanges traditional model of galaxy formation
	- Provides a solution to the problem of missing mass(WHIM), detected by absorption
	
JKCS 041
	- Farthest galaxy cluster observed on earth, 10.2 billion ly away, z=1.9; Cetus
	- Discovered with Chandra and optical and infrared telescope
	- Image is a composite of X-ray from Chandra and optical from VLT and optical and infrared from DSS
	- First detected by UKIRT survey
	- Chandra provides evidence that JKCS is a group of galaxy or a filament of galaxy along the LOS
	- Provides insights into how the universe evolved in the early stages

MACS J0717.5+3745
	- galaxy cluster located at constellation auriga, in MACS survey
	- Formed by four separate galaxy clusters in a collision
	- Cluster B exhibit Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
	- Forms the largest einstein rings
	-  NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (diffuse emission in blue), Hubble Space Telescope (red, green, and blue), and the NSF's Jansky Very Large Array (diffuse emission in pink)
	- Dark matter and hot gas line up well which suggests that the cluster havn't collided(different from the Bullet Cluster)
	- JVLA image shows lensed objects
Bullet cluster
	- Carina; two colliding clusters
	- stars(seen in optical) were not greatly affected by collision(mostly empty)
	- Hot gas(seen in X-ray) - most of baryonic matter-> interact electromagnetically causing them to slow down
	- Dark matter(seen through gravitational lensing) lensing is strongest in two separated regions near the visible galaxy
	- Dark matter region bypassed the gas region during collision 
	- Offset of the center of total mass from baryonic mass (cannot be explained by MOBD)

Others

GRB 150101B
	- Short gamma-ray burst, detected by Fermi, Swift, CHandra, Hubble...
	- GW 170817: analogous to this neutron star merger event

GW 151226
	- Gravitational wave obed by LIGO
	- second confirmed(after GW150914) and third detected gravitational wave signal
	- results from the coalescence(merging) of two blackholes
	- General relativity offers a good prediction
	- More massive than a neutron star->blackhole
	- 14.2+7.5->20.8 solar mass(E=mc^2)

MACS J1149.5+2223
	- galaxy cluster that bends light through lensing, at Leo
	- a system of merging galaxy cluster
	- CHandra(X-ray,blue), Hubble(optical,colorful) and other telescopes(inc. VLA, pink,radio)
	- x-RAY reveal gas in the merging clusters with temp of millions of degrees
	- Optical shows galaxy in and behind clusters(lensing)
	- Radio data sow shock waves and turbulence created by merging
Lensed star: Icarus
	- blue supergiant, most distanced star observed(z=1.49)
	- both strong lensing and microlensing(by a star along los)

- Sky surveys
Chandra Isotropic Universe Survey
	- Full sjy, Chandra and XMM-Newton, observing galaxy clusters(X)
	- Explore whether the expansion of the universe is isotrophic
	- Temperature of a gasca be used to estimate X-ray luminosity; which can be calculated wth another method that depends on expansion
	- results give the apparent expansion speed across the sky->not entirely isotrophic
	- Possible explanations: Galaxy clusters are moving together not because of cosmic expansion(great great attractor)
	- Universe is not isotrophic(dark energy is not uniform)
	- Or possible Other cosmic material that interfere with the light(e.g gas or dust along the LOS that obscure some photon)
	- However, this bias is unlikely since that the anisotrphy in this study match that of other ones from dif wavelength
Hubble CANDELS Survey
	- 800 square arcmin with HST; NIR to mid ultraviolet
	- Evolution of galaxies in early universe
	- Evolution of massive elliptical galaxy(ultra-compact and burned out): finish star forming very early
	- a link betwen compact elliptical galaxy and submilimeter galaxy(progenitor of the former)
	- Survey is on two epoch in cosmic evolution
		- Cosmic dawn: <1b year, when the first seeds of LSS form
		- Cosmic High Noon: 2-4b years, when galaxies grow as gas flowed into them
